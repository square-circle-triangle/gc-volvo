# Example of a very basic, click-through gallery

Add any number of images to the `.image_wrap` element (1024*768px, or change CSS accordingly if you wish to use other dimensions). JavaScript will pick up whether touch events are available and use instead of click events (speed improvement on touch devices).
On touch/click the next image will be shown. From the last image it will go back to the first.
